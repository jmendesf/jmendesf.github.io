I am a PhD student at the GREYC laboratory, where I am part of the [Image team](https://www.greyc.fr/equipes/image/).
My current research focuses on mathematical morphology, with a particular interest in partial partition trees and image descriptors. 

More broadly, my research interest include **mathematical morphology**, **digital geometry** and **digital topology**. 

My doctoral thesis, titled "_Partial Partition Trees: Unified Framework, Topological Modelling, and Connected Operators_",  aims to study several hierarchical image descriptors from mathematical morphology, with a particular interest for the descripton of the topology of images.
These structures includes, but is not limited to, the tree of shapes, the complete tree of shapes, and the topological tree of shapes.

More recently, I started preliminary research on defining a topological distance between these structures. 
Moreover, I am investigating how these structures can be integrated into deep learning frameworks, with the aim of improving the topological consistency of the models.
